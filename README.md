About Project:

I got first notification on the 7th instant of this month and since then till now I worked on it.
Failed to share note to some particular user for the first time in this short amount of time.
But if guidance be given It will be possible for me to implent with ease. Or It may take some more
effort of mine. I believe, If I continues, It will be possible

Regarding API:

I am good at making simple rest api. As here user is attached, things might be bit complex.
It may take upto 2 weeks to master in rest api
